Ever used Canva, and found hundreds of elements that you really like but then realise are all pro elements which you cannot use? Want to get rid of that frustrating feeling?

If so, look no further! This chrome xxtension enables you to filter out pro elements while using Canva.

To use, download the latest version from the releases page. Then, unzip the file. Next, open chrome, type "chrome://extensions" into chrome and press enter. Then, turn on developer mode (option should be at top-right of screen). Then, click the load unpacked option on the left hand side of the screen, and select the root folder "Canva Pro Elements Remover Vx.x.x".

No other steps are required to use the extension. When you design your next project using Canva, you will see blanks appearing in place of the pro elements, preventing you from getting distracted while doing work!

This project is still a work in progress. Future functionalities planned include:

1) Allow the space occupied by pro elements to be replaced by free elements
2) Option to disable the extension to show pro elements when necessary
